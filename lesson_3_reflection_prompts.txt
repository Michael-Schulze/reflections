When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
->>
If I want to share my project with other people, or if I need help in some parts of code sections.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
->>
I only want to push working changes into Github and not everything what I am trying.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you use one instead of another?
->>
Fork is a special clone on GitHub only, where a project of other user is cloned to your account. I would use it, if I need something existing with some special changes for me only.
Clone is a copie of the whole repository and can be local or remote.
Branch is a section of a repository, can be used for testing some featerus without destroying the master path.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
->>
Latest state makes it easier to make changes in a group. It can be easier merged.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier, and what would be harder?
->>
DropBox or other cloud services. Easier would be that everyone can use there prefered system and just the final files would be transfered.
It would be harder to see the changes of other developers and it is harder to coordinate.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master?  What benefits does each approach have?
->>
Every change which affects the behaviour significantly should be done on branch. Also every new feature, where several people work on.
